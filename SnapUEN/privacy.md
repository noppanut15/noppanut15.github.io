# Privacy Policy

- **Developer:** Noppanut Ploywong
- **Last Updated:** December 2, 2025

## 1. Introduction
We prioritize the security of your financial data while using third-party services to support the app via advertising. This policy explicitly distinguishes between the financial data processed locally on your device and the data collected by our advertising partners for tracking purposes.

By using SnapUEN, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Financial & QR Data (Strictly Local)
**We do not collect, store, track, transmit, or share your scanned QR code content.**

* **Local Processing:** All QR code parsing (PayNow UEN numbers, transaction amounts, merchant names, and photos imported from your gallery) is performed 100% locally on your device using on-device processing.
* **No Transmission:** This financial transaction data never leaves your device. It is not sent to our servers, Google AdMob, or any third party.

## 3. Data Collected by Google AdMob (Third-Party Advertising)
SnapUEN uses **Google AdMob** to display advertisements. Google AdMob collects certain data from your device to provide relevant ads and measure advertising effectiveness. This data is collected by Google, linked to your identity, and **used for tracking purposes**.

**What SnapUEN Does NOT Collect:**
* Precise GPS location
* Contacts or address book
* Browsing history outside the app
* Microphone or audio recordings
* Your photo library (except QR images you explicitly choose to import)
* Financial account information or payment card details
* Government IDs or sensitive documents

## 4. Cookies
SnapUEN does not use cookies directly. However, third-party services like Google AdMob may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information and improve their advertising services. You have the option to accept or refuse these cookies through your device settings. Refusing cookies may affect the functionality of personalized advertising but will not impact core app features.

## 5. Tracking Disclosure
Google AdMob uses the data types listed above (Location, Identifiers, Usage Data, and Diagnostics) to **track you** across apps and websites owned by other companies for advertising purposes.

You will be asked for permission via the iOS **App Tracking Transparency (ATT)** prompt ("Allow "SnapUEN" to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites?").
* **If you allow tracking:** Google AdMob will use your data to deliver personalized ads relevant to your interests across different apps and websites.
* **If you ask not to track:** You will still see ads, but they will be non-personalized, and we will restrict Google's use of your identifiers for tracking purposes as required by Apple's guidelines.
