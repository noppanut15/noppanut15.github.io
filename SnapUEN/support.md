## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. I scanned a QR code, but I can't find the "Pay" button.
SnapUEN is a **utility scanner**, not a payment app. We do not process money.
**How to pay:**
1. Scan the QR code with SnapUEN.
2. Tap the **Copy icon** next to the UEN or Mobile Number.
3. Open your banking app (e.g., Wise or your home bank's app).
4. Paste the details there to complete the transfer.

### 2. The app says "No PayNow Found".
This usually happens if the QR code is not a Singapore PayNow or SGQR code.
* Ensure you are scanning a valid **SGQR** label (look for the "SGQR" or "PayNow" logo).
* Some generic URL QR codes (like restaurant menus) do not contain payment data.

### 3. Does the app work offline?
**Yes.** All QR code parsing and data extraction happens 100% locally on your device. You do not need an internet connection to scan and copy details.

### 4. Why do you need Camera access?
We need access to your camera solely to scan the QR codes. We do not record or save any video/images from your camera feed.

### 5. Why do you ask for "Tracking" permission?
We use Google AdMob to show advertisements to support the development of this free app. Enabling tracking allows us to show ads that are more relevant to you, but the app functions fully even if you decline.
